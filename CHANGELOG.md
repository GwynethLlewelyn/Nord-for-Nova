## Version v0.1.5-alpha

Very minor tweaks on the `extension.json` file and a few updates to the README.

## Version v0.1.4-alpha

Submitted to official Nova extension library! But still gives a 500 error, so you have no choice but to install it manually.

## Version v0.1.3-alpha

Changing back to the `Nord.novaextension` to see if this works and can be published on the 'official' library.

## Version v0.1.2-alpha

- Adding mandatory `extension.png` image (should have been referenced somewhere in the instructions)
- _Another_ version renumbering...

## Version 0.1.1

Migrating to MIT license

## Version 0.1.0

Renumbering versions, I hope this will not break _everything_...

## Version 1.0-alpha

Initial release
