## Version v0.1.10

Tiny change on `Nord.css`: moved the `meta` tag to the top, _before_ the comments I had added.

## Version v0.1.9

- _Yet another_ version renumbering!
- Fixed a tiny Markdown error on the README file
- Entering Beta stage

## Version v0.1.8

Fixed a tiny Markdown error on the README file. Entering Beta stage.

## Version v0.1.7-alpha

After removing the extra images, I just got an 'invalid vendor' error when submitting; this was easily fixed: somehow, all the vendors I had registered disappeared! Fixed. Enjoy Nord for Nova! :-)

## Version v0.1.6-alpha

Removed all extra images, just to see if that's what was causing the issues with publishing to the extension library... and added a @2x image for the extension, too.

## Version v0.1.5-alpha

Very minor tweaks on the `extension.json` file and a few updates to the README.

## Version v0.1.4-alpha

Submitted to official Nova extension library! But still gives a 500 error, so you have no choice but to install it manually.

## Version v0.1.3-alpha

Changing back to the `Nord.novaextension` to see if this works and can be published on the 'official' library.

## Version v0.1.2-alpha

- Adding mandatory `extension.png` image (should have been referenced somewhere in the instructions)
- _Another_ version renumbering...

## Version 0.1.1

Migrating to MIT license

## Version 0.1.0

Renumbering versions, I hope this will not break _everything_...

## Version 1.0-alpha

Initial release
