## Version v0.4.3

Adding support for the new tags supported by Nova 7.X

## Version v0.4.2

Added a swatch file for the Nord palette. Useful for using inside the Nova Color Picker. I don't know how to automatically load it, so you will have to install it manually (see [README.md](README.md)).

## Version v0.4.1

Minimalistic change, basically just to get the logo on the [README.md](README.md) and tweak some Git options. No style changes.

## Version v0.4.0

Adds experimental support for the additional styling tags used by the `advanced PHP` extension. Thanks to [Dennis Osaj](https://extensions.panic.com/extensions/dennisosaj/dennisosaj.advancedPHP/) for the encouragement to support these as well.

## Version v0.3.1

Fixed a few 'bugs' on the explanations... the style didn't change.

## Version v0.3.0

- Slight changes on the [README](README.md) to reflect the official launch of Nova
- Fixed the logo/lettering to be consistent with the released Nova logo/lettering
- Changed `code` block (especially in Markdown) to a less-annoying colour/background (thanks [@skurfer](https://github.com/skurfer)!) â€” issue [#1](https://github.com/GwynethLlewelyn/Nord.novaextension/issues/1)
- Changed comment colour as per [Nord recommendations/poll](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord/issues/94)
- Changed a few colours based on a careful re-reading of the old Coda 2 stylesheet, but there are probably a few more things worth changing...

## Version v0.2.0

GitHub does not like versions that have more than single digits, it sorts them wrongly. Bummer! Maybe the Extension Library doesn't like them, either? Nobody else seems to be using more than a single digit for the versioning. Anyway, bumped up to 0.2.0 without making any significant changes.

## Version v0.1.11

Removed the extra CSS file that I used as a reference for the Nord colours; apparently, Nova will grab _anything_ that is under `Themes/` and _try_ to load it as a theme... which is weird. That reference sheet does not make any difference (and it can be grabbed from Arctic Ice Studio's GitHub repository anyway).

## Version v0.1.10

Tiny change on `Nord.css`: moved the `meta` tag to the top, _before_ the comments I had added.

## Version v0.1.9

- _Yet another_ version renumbering!
- Fixed a tiny Markdown error on the README file
- Entering Beta stage

## Version v0.1.8

Fixed a tiny Markdown error on the README file. Entering Beta stage.

## Version v0.1.7-alpha

After removing the extra images, I just got an 'invalid vendor' error when submitting; this was easily fixed: somehow, all the vendors I had registered disappeared! Fixed. Enjoy Nord for Nova! :-)

## Version v0.1.6-alpha

Removed all extra images, just to see if that's what was causing the issues with publishing to the extension library... and added a @2x image for the extension, too.

## Version v0.1.5-alpha

Very minor tweaks on the `extension.json` file and a few updates to the README.

## Version v0.1.4-alpha

Submitted to official Nova extension library! But still gives a 500 error, so you have no choice but to install it manually.

## Version v0.1.3-alpha

Changing back to the `Nord.novaextension` to see if this works and can be published on the 'official' library.

## Version v0.1.2-alpha

- Adding mandatory `extension.png` image (should have been referenced somewhere in the instructions)
- _Another_ version renumbering...

## Version 0.1.1

Migrating to MIT license

## Version 0.1.0

Renumbering versions, I hope this will not break _everything_...

## Version 1.0-alpha

Initial release
