# Nord theme for Nova

Based on the fantastic work made by the [Arctic Ice Studio team for Coda 2](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-coda/), which is released under a MIT license.

## Instructions

Of course, you need to have [Nova](https://panic.com/nova) installed (FYI, it only works under macOS).

If you're a proud owner of Nova, you ought to be able to go to **Extensions > Extension Library > Themes (tab)** and pick the theme from there — search for `Nord`.

If that doesn't work, just clone this project (or download it from the releases page), it'll magically turn into a 'component' thingy, and you can then double-click it to add this theme to Nova!

## Disclaimer

[Nova](https://panic.com/nova) is the new editor from [Panic Inc.](https://panic.com/)

I'm neither an employee, nor a collaborator, nor a stakeholder in either Panic Inc. and/or Arctic Ice Studio. I just love both their work as a faithful fan!

Please take into account that I hardly know what I'm doing. Hope it works for you. This is being released for the sole purpose of testing how designing themes for Nova work; no infringements are intended; also, I might be tweaking this theme frequently, as I start figuring out how the colour assignments actually work; thus, _caveat utilitor_.

## Special thanks

Thanks to [Dennis Osaj](https://github.com/dennisosaj), designer of the wonderful [advanced PHP extension](https://extensions.panic.com/extensions/dennisosaj/dennisosaj.advancedPHP/) as well as the [Varia theme](https://extensions.panic.com/extensions/dennisosaj/dennisosaj.VariaTheme/), who pointed out that I should add a few more styling classes to deal with the specificities of `advanced PHP` — as well as XML, HTML and JavaScript, which are better supported by the Varia Theme.

This version of the `Nord theme for Nova` is adding experimental support for `advanced PHP`, but be advised that things may still be broken or not display properly... I'm still learning about all these things!
