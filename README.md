# Nord theme for Nova

Based on the fantastic work made by the [Artic Ice Studio team for Coda 2](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-coda/).

## Instructions

Clone this project, change the folder name to `Nord.novaextension`, it'll magically turn into a 'component' thingy, and you can then add this theme to Nova!

## Disclaimer

I hardly know what I'm doing here. Hope it works for you.
