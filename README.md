# Nord theme for Nova

Based on the fantastic work made by the [Arctic Ice Studio team for Coda 2](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-coda/), which is released under a MIT license.

## Instructions

Of course, you need to have [Nova](https://panic.com/nova) installed (FYI, it only works under macOS).

Clone this project (or download it from the releases page), it'll magically turn into a 'component' thingy, and you can then double-click it to add this theme to Nova!

## Disclaimer

[Nova](https://panic.com/nova) is the upcoming new editor from [Panic Inc.](https://panic.com/), currently in private beta development.

Please take into account that I hardly know what I'm doing. Hope it works for you. This is being released for the sole purpose of testing how designing themes for Nova work; I might be tweaking it frequently, as I start figuring out how the colour assignments actually work; thus, _caveat utilitor_.
